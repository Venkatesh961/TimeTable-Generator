,"Year: The B.Tech degree requires four years of study. In each session, courses related to all the four years will be scheduled",
Requirement Code,Description,Classification
REQ-01,"The software should make the best effort to shedule the courses of a session. The software should be capable of reading an existing timetable for modifications, i.e., with minimal changes add another course or remove an exiting course from the time table. The designers should include certain configurations to make this requirement feasible",Desired
REQ-02-Config,"The software should provide facility to configure the parameters required for scheduling. For example: slot duration of lecture can be 1 hour or  1.5 hour or  45 minutes, etc. Different parameters that are read by the software are : course name, course code, LTPSC structure, instructor name, classroom name and capacity, lab room name and capacity, number of students registered for course, etc. The data will be provided in an csv/ excel sheet. The software should be capable of reading the configuration files from csv/ excel. ",Mandatory
REQ-03,"The courses needs to be scheduled in a classroom that is sufficient to hold the number of registered students. In case, it is not possible to schedule all the registered students in a single classroom due to unavailability then the students needs to be divided into two sections. Currently CSE department has two sections for majority of the courses",Mandatory
REQ-04- CONFLICTS,The course components should be scheduled/ distributed over the week. Avoid scheduling multiple components of a course in a single day of the week. Labs can be scheduled in continuation of a lecture or tutorial,Mandatory
REQ-05,Courses with same course code can be offered by different departments. The software should schedule each instance of the course separately,Mandatory
REQ-06,"The course scheduling must adhere to the number of hours specified in the  LTPS structure (Lecture, Tutorial, Practical, Self-study) of the course. Wherein 1 hour of lecture is equal to 1 credit, 2 hours of lab equal to 1 credit, 1 hour of tutorial equal to 1 credit and 4 hours of self-study equal to 1 credit. The credit requiements of the course should be satisfied by the scheduling software",Mandatory
REQ-07,"Elective courses may be grouped into baskets, which will allow simultaneous scheduling of courses in a basket. Elective courses can be registered by students belonging to different departments and semesters, care should be taken to avoid room conflict /faculty conflict/ student conflict.",Mandatory
REQ-08,Lab sessions of the course needs to be allocated based on the lab room capacity. This would require making multiple batches from the total number of registered students for the course,Mandatory
REQ-09-BREAKS,"A morning break (default 15 minutes), lunch break (default 45 minutes) and inter-class break (default 5-minute) should be included while scheduling courses on each day of the week.",Desired
REQ-10- FACULTY,"A course instructor should not have consecutive classes. In case, where it is unaviodable to schedule multiple classes, at least 3 hours of  time difference should be maintained between classes scheduled in a single day. A lab component can be scheduled after a lecture / tutorial",Mandatory
REQ-11-FACULTY,A course instructor should be able to provide his/ her desired day and time of the week where the course component needs to be scheduled. The software should schedule such requests first and later schedule other courses. The software should provide facility to accept such preferences,Mandatory
REQ-12- COORD,The software should provide facility for the time-table coordinator to reserve certain time slots. In such cases the software should not allocate any courses to those time slots of the day,Mandatory
REQ-13-GCALENDER,The software should provide facilities to integrate the desired courses slots into his/her Google calender.,Special
REQ-14-VIEW,"The software should provide means for visualizing the Time-table for different viewers: faculty, student, coordinator, etc.  There should be facility to export the time table views in an excel format.",Mandatory
REQ-15-EXAM,The software should be able to schedule the exam time-table for the courses in such a way as to minimize the number of days required to conduct the exams. The only change here is to schedule  the seating arrangment for a course in multiple classroom with one student per bench.,Special
REQ-16-ANALYTICS,"The software needs to provide reports on room usage, instructor effort, student effort",Desired
REQ-17-ASSIST,Taching assistants needs to be allocated for courses where the registered students are greater than 100 (configurable parameter). Lab assistants needs to be allocated for courses with lab components. The list of assistants along with their course/ time preferences will be provided in an excel/ csv file,Desired
REQ-18-LUNCH,The software should schedule the lunch breaks for different year/ departments in a staggered fashion so as to avoid over-crowding of boys mess.,Mandatory
